# TitanicSurvival

I have conducted prelimiary data analysis on the Titanic Survival Prediction dataset on Kaggle which can be found at the following link. 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishkumarjayswal/titanic-datasets

Upon doing so, I selected relevant features to predict the survival prediction of a passenger on the Titanic (I found that economically advantaged passengers generally had a higher survival rate than other passengers-- strong correlation between Class and Survival fields).

Then I created a streamlit app to use the model to make predictions about a passenger's survival.
